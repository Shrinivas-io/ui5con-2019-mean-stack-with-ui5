# “MEAN Stack”.replace(“A”, “OpenUI5”)
  
In the UI5 world there is a belief that UI5 is not to be used out of the SAP world. Frankly, the reality is quite different.
In our session we will show you how you can use UI5 “out of the box” and easily integrate our framework into any hype or stack.
We’ll build a modern full stack App from scratch, using OpenUI5 as frontend layer.

## Steps

Now we're going to install all the dependencies needed for that project.

#### Download the assets
- [package.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3xter666/ui5con-2019-mean-stack-with-ui5/01_configure_project_dependencies/package.json)
- [package-lock.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3xter666/ui5con-2019-mean-stack-with-ui5/01_configure_project_dependencies/package-lock.json)


When done, run the following NPM command:
